# siamese-network

This repository contains the implementation of Siamese Networks for both image and text similarity using PyTorch and TensorFlow respectively. Siamese Networks are a type of neural network architecture that learns to differentiate between pairs of inputs. They are commonly used for tasks such as image similarity, face recognition, and text similarity.
